# Homework 1 + 2 Code

## Changes made

In the ruby version I made some small changes based on language semantics. In ruby there are helpers to automatically generate getters and setters for any member variables. I used the `attr_reader` helper to make sure there were readers for all of the variables I cared about. 

I also made a small adjustment by moving the center property to the base class, because all of the shapes have this property.
